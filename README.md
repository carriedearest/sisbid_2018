What is this project about?

This project is to illustrate how to assemble an analysis son GitHub in a way that improves the odds that someone else will be able to reproduce the results.

Typically, for a real project, insert discussion of your understanding of the project.

This is a practice project for the UW Summer Institute class on Reproducibility in Big Data Research.

We are doing a good job!!!
